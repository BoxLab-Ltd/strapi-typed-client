# Authentication

`strapi-typed-client` supports Bearer token authentication for both the runtime client and the CLI code generator. This page covers all the ways to configure authentication.

## Client Authentication

### Token via Constructor

The most common approach is to pass the API token when creating the client:

```typescript
import { StrapiClient } from '@/strapi'

const strapi = new StrapiClient({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:1337',
    token: 'your-strapi-api-token',
})
```

The token is sent as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header with every request.

### Setting Token Dynamically

You can set or update the token after the client has been created using the `setToken` method:

```typescript
const strapi = new StrapiClient({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:1337',
})

// Set token later (e.g., after user login)
strapi.setToken('your-strapi-api-token')

// Now all subsequent requests include the token
const data = await strapi.posts.find()
```

This is useful in scenarios where the token is not available at initialization time, such as after a user authenticates.

## Session Auth (Refresh Tokens, Strapi 5.43+)

Strapi 5.43 introduced a session-based JWT mode for users-permissions: a short-lived access JWT (~10 minutes) plus a rotating refresh token. Enable it on the backend:

```typescript
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
    'users-permissions': {
        config: {
            jwtManagement: 'refresh',
        },
    },
}
```

`strapi-typed-client` detects this mode automatically at generation time — the plugin reads `jwtManagement` from the backend config and bakes the resulting mode into the generated client as the exported `AUTH_MODE` constant. Toggling the mode on the backend changes the schema hash, so the next `generate` (or Next.js dev/build) picks it up. No client configuration is required.

### What the client does in refresh mode

- **Access token in memory.** Auth responses that carry a `jwt` (`login`, `register`, OAuth `callback`, `resetPassword`, `changePassword`, `confirmEmail`) store it on the client instance automatically. It is sent as `Authorization: Bearer` on every request and never touches `localStorage`.
- **Transparent refresh on 401/403.** When a request sent with the session's own token fails with 401 (expired access token), the client performs `POST /api/auth/refresh` and retries the original request once. The same happens for a **403 on a fully anonymous request** — that is what Strapi actually returns when a protected route is hit with no credentials (the anonymous caller authenticates as the public role and gets `ForbiddenError`, never 401), and it is exactly the page-reload bootstrap case: access token gone from memory, refresh cookie still alive. Concurrent failures share a single in-flight refresh (single-flight). If the refresh fails, the session is dropped and the original error propagates — your `onError` hook fires as usual. A 403 under any Bearer is an honest permission error and always passes through untouched.
- **Dead-session latch.** Once the server definitively rejects a refresh (4xx) — or after `logout()`/`clearToken()` — the automatic refresh goes quiet instead of re-hitting the backend on every subsequent 401/403. A successful `login()` or an explicit `auth.refresh()` lifts the latch (call `refresh()` to resume a session started in another tab). Transient failures (5xx, network errors) never latch and never drop the tokens.
- **Race-safe.** A refresh that is already on the wire when you `login()` or `logout()` cannot override them: its late outcome is discarded, so a sign-out never gets resurrected by a stray refresh success, and a fresh login never gets wiped by a stale refresh rejection.
- **Browser-only by default.** The entire session flow — token capture, Bearer injection, automatic refresh — is inert in Node unless you pass a `tokenStorage` (see [Persisting the session](#persisting-the-session-react-native-and-other-apps)). There is no cookie jar for a cookie-based refresh, and silently storing tokens on a client instance that may be shared across requests (e.g. a module-level singleton in Next.js) would leak one user's session into another's requests. An explicit `auth.refresh()` still performs the request and reports the result, but stores nothing outside the browser. Server-side code should keep using long-lived API tokens via `token` (or explicit `setToken`).
- **Plays fair with `onRequest`.** If your hook sets the `Authorization` header, it owns auth for that request — the session flow will not refresh or retry it. The hook also runs for the flow's own `POST /api/auth/refresh`, so infrastructure headers (tenant ids, proxy keys) reach it; the flow never attaches `Authorization` to its refresh request itself.
- **Typed session methods.** `auth.refresh(): Promise<boolean>` and `auth.logout(): Promise<void>` are generated with full types.

### Setup

The refresh token lives in an httpOnly cookie (`strapi_up_refresh`) by default, so the client must send credentials:

```typescript
const strapi = new StrapiClient({
    baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL!,
    credentials: 'include',
})
```

Bootstrap the session once on app load — after a page reload the in-memory access token is gone, but the cookie can mint a new one:

```typescript
const isLoggedIn = await strapi.auth.refresh()
// true  → session restored, requests are authenticated
// false → no live session, show the login screen
```

The rest is transparent:

```typescript
await strapi.auth.login({ identifier: 'user@example.com', password: '...' })
await strapi.articles.find() // Bearer attached; auto-refreshed when expired
await strapi.auth.logout() // POST /api/auth/logout + clears local tokens
```

### Non-httpOnly setups

With `sessions.httpOnly: false` on the backend, refresh tokens are returned in the response body instead of a cookie. The client handles this too: `AuthResponse.refreshToken` is captured in memory and sent in the refresh request body. No extra configuration is needed (and `credentials` is not required for this variant).

### Overriding the detected mode

`StrapiClientConfig.authMode` overrides the baked-in default per instance:

```typescript
// A refresh-mode client that should behave like a legacy one (e.g. a
// server-side script using a long-lived API token):
const strapi = new StrapiClient({
    baseURL: '...',
    token: process.env.STRAPI_TOKEN,
    authMode: 'legacy',
})
```

::: info
Legacy backends are entirely unaffected: a client generated against a backend without `jwtManagement: 'refresh'` sends the same requests and headers as before — no refresh calls, no behavior change.
:::

### Persisting the session (React Native and other apps)

By default the session lives in memory only. Strapi rotates the refresh token on every refresh, so an app that wants to stay signed in across launches has to store the rotated token. Pass a `tokenStorage` and the client does that for you. This needs `sessions.httpOnly: false` on the backend, so that Strapi returns the refresh token in the response body.

```typescript
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'
import { StrapiClient } from './strapi'

// Face ID / fingerprint before the token is read; drop it if a prompt is too much
const secure = { requireAuthentication: true }
const KEY = 'strapi_refresh_token'

export const strapi = new StrapiClient({
    baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
    tokenStorage: {
        getRefreshToken: () => SecureStore.getItemAsync(KEY, secure),
        setRefreshToken: token => SecureStore.setItemAsync(KEY, token, secure),
        clearRefreshToken: () => SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(KEY),
    },
    onTokenRefreshed: ({ accessToken }) => {
        // optional: hand the new access token to a websocket, analytics, ...
    },
    onSessionExpired: () => {
        // the server rejected the session: the stored token is already gone
        router.replace('/sign-in')
    },
})

// App start: restore the session from secure storage
const isLoggedIn = await strapi.auth.refresh()
```

What the client does with it:

- **Login** stores the refresh token (`auth.login`, `register`, `resetPassword`, `changePassword`, the OAuth `callback` and `confirmEmail`).
- **Refresh** (an expired access token, the anonymous-403 bootstrap, or your explicit `auth.refresh()`) reads the token from storage the first time it is needed, so a biometric prompt appears then and not on every request. Concurrent requests share one read and one refresh, and the token is cached in memory afterwards. The rotated token is written back before the refresh is reported as done.
- **Logout** (`auth.logout()`) reads the token if it is not in memory yet, so the server session is revoked even right after an app restart, then clears storage.
- `auth.refresh()` returns `false` without a network request when storage is empty.

Storage methods may be sync (MMKV) or async (Keychain, `expo-secure-store`). Only the refresh token is stored; the access token stays in memory.

| Hook                                               | Fires when                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onTokenRefreshed({ accessToken, refreshToken? })` | A refresh succeeded and the rotated token is stored.                                                                 |
| `onSessionExpired({ reason, status? })`            | The server definitively rejected the session (a 4xx on refresh, or a 2xx without a jwt). Storage is already cleared. |

Neither hook runs for transient failures (5xx, network, a cancelled biometric prompt, so the user can retry) or for an explicit `logout()` / `clearToken()`. A throwing hook or a failing storage never breaks the request; enable `debug` to see them logged.

::: warning
Pass the storage of one user per client instance. Providing `tokenStorage` also switches the session flow on outside a browser (for React Native runtimes without `window`), which the client otherwise refuses to do so that a shared server-side instance never keeps one user's tokens for another.
:::

### Using Environment Variables

A recommended pattern is to read the token from an environment variable:

```typescript
const strapi = new StrapiClient({
    baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL!,
    token: process.env.STRAPI_TOKEN,
})
```

::: tip
In Next.js, environment variables without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are only available on the server side. Since API tokens should remain secret, use `STRAPI_TOKEN` (without the prefix) and only create the client in server components or API routes.
:::

Example `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337
STRAPI_TOKEN=your-strapi-api-token-here
```

## Creating API Tokens in Strapi

To generate an API token in the Strapi admin panel:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Under **Global Settings**, click **API Tokens**.
3. Click **Create new API Token**.
4. Configure the token:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Frontend Read-Only").
    - **Token type**: Choose `Read-only`, `Full access`, or `Custom`.
    - **Token duration**: Set an expiration or choose unlimited.
5. Click **Save** and copy the generated token.

::: warning
The token is only displayed once after creation. Store it securely in your environment variables or a secrets manager. If you lose it, you will need to regenerate a new token.

### Token Types

| Type        | Permissions                         | Use Case                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Read-only   | `find` and `findOne` on all content | Public frontend, SSG/ISR      |
| Full access | All CRUD operations on all content  | Admin dashboards, server-side |
| Custom      | Fine-grained per-content-type       | Specific use cases            |

## CLI Authentication

### Plugin `requireAuth` Option

The `strapi-typed-client` plugin can be configured to require authentication for its schema endpoint. When enabled, the CLI must provide a valid token to fetch the schema.

In your Strapi project's `config/plugins.ts`:

```typescript
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
    'strapi-typed-client': {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
            requireAuth: true, // Require Bearer token for schema endpoint
        },
    },
}
```

By default, `requireAuth` is `false` in development and `true` in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`). In development, the schema endpoint is publicly accessible for convenience.

### Passing a Token to the CLI

When the plugin has `requireAuth: true`, pass the token using the `--token` flag:

```bash
npx strapi-types generate --token YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Or using an environment variable:

```bash
STRAPI_TOKEN=your-token npx strapi-types generate
```

::: info
The CLI uses the same Bearer token mechanism as the runtime client. Any API token with at least read access will work for schema fetching.
:::

### Full CLI Example

```bash
# Without auth (requireAuth: false, the default)
npx strapi-types generate --url http://localhost:1337

# With auth (requireAuth: true)
npx strapi-types generate --url http://localhost:1337 --token your-api-token

# Using environment variable
STRAPI_TOKEN=your-api-token npx strapi-types generate --url http://localhost:1337
```

## Security Recommendations

### Development

During local development, `requireAuth` defaults to `false` so you can regenerate types without managing tokens:

```typescript
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
    'strapi-typed-client': {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
            requireAuth: false,
        },
    },
}
```

### Production

In production, `requireAuth` defaults to `true` automatically. You can also set it explicitly:

```typescript
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
    'strapi-typed-client': {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
            requireAuth: true,
        },
    },
}
```

::: warning
The schema endpoint exposes the complete structure of your content types, including field names, relation targets, and component structures. In production environments, enable `requireAuth` to prevent this information from being publicly accessible.
:::

### CI/CD Pipelines

When generating types in a CI/CD pipeline, store the token as a secret and pass it to the CLI:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Generate Strapi types
  run: npx strapi-types generate --url ${{ secrets.STRAPI_URL }} --token ${{ secrets.STRAPI_TOKEN }}
```
