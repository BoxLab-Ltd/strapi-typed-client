If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public issue.**

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to release a fix within 7 days for critical issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to the `strapi-typed-client` npm package. Issues in Strapi itself should be reported to the [Strapi team](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security).
